Q: What can you observe from the printouts of the
threads on the terminal?

Program is created with a number of Threads decided by us, after they are created, 
The Main program run and finish, after that the Threads are running in circle a number of iteration,
This Threads as they run as in a circle they will finished once they finished their task and will
continue to the next thread to continue task. 

Main appears to finished first than all the Threads because they run in parallel and Latency might happen between the prints
